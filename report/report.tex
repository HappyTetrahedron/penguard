Don't you know this problem? You're just taking your penguin to party as usual, and all of a sudden it is stolen! 

We're tired of this. So now we're going to solve this problem once and for all. Penguard is an application that can prevent such things from happening by alarming us beforehand.
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}

Penguard is an application that allows users to monitor objects and informs them when these objects get too far away from them. This can be used as a theft alarm or as an aid to prevent forgetting objects.

While this principle is widely applicable, the idea stems from the need to guard a plush penguin mascot at an event and prevent it from being stolen. In the style of this particular use case, the objects to be monitored will henceforth be called ``penguins'', while the people monitoring them will be called ``guardians''.

Penguins can be guarded by several guardians at once, in which case it is sufficient for the penguin to be ``seen'' by one of them. Also, guardians can monitor several penguins at once. The guardians should know at all times which other guardians see which penguins.

We want to be able to use any kind of bluetooth device as a penguin. The only requirements should be that it supports bluetooth, and that it doesn't automatically turn off bluetooth after a while of inactivity, even when no device is paired to it.

As an extension, penguins should be able to detect when they are ``lost'' and act upon it. This obviously contradicts the goal to support any bluetooth device. We could support both options by adding an optional protocol, the Penguard Penguin Protocol through which penguins can communicate with the guardians. When the penguin supports the protocol, it can detect and act upon being lost, otherwise not. We want to keep this option in mind and implement it if we have enough time.

The major challenges will be

\begin{itemize}
    \item Implementing a peer-to-peer protocol for the guardians
    \item Detecting bluetooth devices and ``tracking'' them without making more assumptions on them
    \item (optional) Implementing a protocol for the penguins to talk to the guardians
\end{itemize}

\section{System Overview}

A Penguard group consists of

\begin{itemize}
    \item One or more penguins being guarded
    \item One or more guardians guarding the penguins
\end{itemize}

Guardians can be part of at most one group at once. Penguins not supporting the Penguard Penguin Protocol can be part of more than one group--this cannot be prevented. Penguins supporting the Penguard Penguin Protocol can only be part of one group. It is theoretically possible for a second group to add it as a penguin not supporting the protocol, though.

The guardians communicate with each other via Internet using a peer-to-peer protocol (the Penguard Guardian Protocol). They can discover each other by using a Penguard Liaison server. The Liaison server stores the guardians' IP addresses and ports and is used to poke holes when the guardians are behind a NAT.

The guardians can detect whether a penguin is in range by using Bluetooth RSSI. That means that guardians are not required to pair with penguins.

Penguins can optionally implement the Penguard Penguin Protocol, which is a Bluetooth Low Energy protocol. The guardians act as clients to the Penguins. The guardians will ping the Penguins regularly, such that the penguin can detect when it is lost by using a timeout. The penguin should also advertise what kind of information it requires from the guardians, which the guardians then must send to it. This information can include phone numbers, email addresses or similar information and should allow for the penguin to contact the guardians when it is lost.

The guardians should be able to find out whether any given penguin supports the Penguard Penguin Protocol.

\subsection{System components}

\begin{description}
    \item [Penguard Android Application] is an Android app required to use Penguard. The app can act as a guardian or as a penguin (guardian mode or penguin mode). When acting as a penguin, it does support the Penguard Penguin Protocol. The user should be able to select what the app should do when the penguin is lost. Options include sounding an alarm and sending GPS coordinates to the guardians via SMS. When acting as a guardian, it provides an user interface that displays the status of each monitored penguin. The status includes the signal strength (RSSI), which of the other guardians see that specific penguin, and whether the penguin supports the Penguard Penguin Protocol.
    \item [Guardians] monitor the penguins using the Penguard app in guardian mode. The term ``guardian'' refers to the Penguard app in guardian mode.
    \item [Penguins] are bluetooth devices. They are registered with the guardians and then monitored. They optionally support the Penguard Penguin Protocol, allowing them to take actions when they are lost.
    \item [Penguard Liaison Server] allows guardians to find each other easily. Guardians register with the Penguard Liaison Server (henceforth referred to as PLS). The server keeps a list of all currently active Penguard groups, including information on the group's guardians and penguins. Guardians can request information on a specific group. The server will reply with all IP addresses and ports of all guardians within that group, such that the new guardian can communicate with the other group members. Furthermore, the server will send information on the penguins being guarded by the group. Guardians can register new groups on the server. When a guardian stops the Penguard service, it is deregistered at the server and removed from its group. The server will automatically purge empty groups. 
\end{description}

\subsection{Calibration}

The range of RSSI values varies between devices, so it should be possible for a guardian to calibrate itself. That is done in a guided process where the penguin is first brought close to the guardian and then slowly carried away.

\subsection{Penguard Guardian Protocol}

The Penguard Guardian Protocol (henceforth referred to as PGP) allows guardians to form groups, and it allows guardians within the same group to communicate.

\subsubsection{Forming groups}

Groups can be formed via a PLS.

One guardian acts as the group's creator. The creator will register the group with the server and add information on the penguins guarded by that group. The server will then notify it whenever a new member registers with the group.

The guardians that do not act as creators will have to register with an existing group. They ask the Liaison server for information on a specific group by sending the group's ID. That ID must hence be known beforehand by the guardian. The server will find the according group and send the IPs of all registered guardians to the new guardian, as well as information on the penguins being guarded.

\subsubsection{Communicating}

When a guardian is registered with a group, it will immediately start sending its status to the other group members. The status includes information about which of the penguins currently guarded it sees. It will also receive similar status updates from other group members.

\subsection{Penguard Penguin Protocol (optional)}

The Penguard Penguin Protocol (henceforth referred to as PPP) allows for penguins to detect when they are lost.

It is a Bluetooth Low Energy protocol.

The penguin should advertise that he supports the PPP. It can be activated and deactivated.

Once activated, the penguin enters its active state. In this state, it will listen for pings from the guardians and acknowledge them. The guardians must send these pings regularly. When the penguin does not receive a ping for long enough, it will consider itself lost and enter its lost state. Once it receives another ping, it will transition back to active state.

When deactivated, the penguin will go in its inactive state. In that state, the penguin will reply to pings saying that it is inactive.

The penguin can also tell the guardians which information it would like to receive from the guardians. The guardians will poll for this information once. They will then send the required information to the penguin. The required information should not change.

The PPP and all components using it are considered optional, meaning that this will be the first thing we strip of the project when time is not sufficient.
